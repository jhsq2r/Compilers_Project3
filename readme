This program is designed to take input as shown below
./Project3 [file]
The input file should contain code for the program to parse
First, it will remove comments and tokenize the file
Second, it will parse according to our languages grammar
  and produce a parse tree
Lastly, it will go through a staticSemantics function that will output
  any error that has to do with scoping of variables

Note: I fixed my Project2 for this if I can get points back
This is a full credit attempt: local option
